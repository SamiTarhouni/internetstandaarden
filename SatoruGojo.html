        <p>Gojo Satoru is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu
          sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. </p>
        <p>Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in
          four hundred years.
          He works as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young
          allies.
          Satoru is a complex individual.</p>
        <p> He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close colleagues, and friends.
          However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives,
          an example being his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies. </p>
        <P>The reason for that is because he believes that the world of Jujutsu scorcerers is not good because of all
          the higher ups.
          He made the decision to become a teacher and make a change by making the lifes of a jujutsu Scorcerers better
          and train them in hopes of reaching his level and
          get rid of all those higher ups who has been in leadership for decades.</p>
