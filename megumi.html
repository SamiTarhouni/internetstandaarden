        <p>Megumi Fushiguro is introduced as a student at Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical High School, where he
          trains to become a jujutsu sorcerer.</p>
        <p>One notable early event in the series involves Megumi and Itadori encountering a cursed spirit at their
          school.
          This encounter leads to Itadori consuming a cursed object to save Megumi and his friends, setting off the main
          plot of the series.</p>
        <p>Megumi is known for his strong jujutsu abilities, particularly his Shadow Technique. As the story progresses,
          he faces various powerful curses and participates in intense battles alongside his fellow students.
          Megumi's stoic demeanor and his internal struggles with the responsibilities of being a jujutsu sorcerer
          contribute to the depth of his character.</p>
        <p>Later in the series, Megumi's past and family background are explored, shedding light on some of the factors
          that shaped his perspective on curses and the jujutsu sorcerer world. His interactions with other characters,
          including Itadori and Nobara, highlight the camaraderie and bonds formed among the students.</p>
